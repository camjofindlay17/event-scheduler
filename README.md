# event-scheduler

Created a scheduler that allows the user to create tasks throughout the day in order to stay organized and maintain productivity.

The user may click in to each hour block and type in a task or event that they may have in that hour and upon refreshing the page, it will be saved to their scheduler. 

The user will be notified of how the day is progressing through multiple intervals. The hours that have elapsed will be marked in gray, while the current hour will be designated as red. For these sections, the user will not be able to edit their schedule.

At the end of the day (6pm), the user's schedule will clear and they will be able to create a new schdule for the next day. Every prompt will repeat beginning at 9 am the next day.
